            So you want to support Wyvern? Great! Here are some of the best ways you can:<br /><br />
            1) play the game <br />
            2) leave a steam/ios/playstore review<br />
            3) engage in our <a>Disocrd</a> server<br />
            4) purchase Wyvern Crowns <br />
            <br />
            If you want to further support the game and the content creators who spend a lot of their time making and
            fixing things for the playerbase, then send them an encouraging message, tell, or in-game mail.<br /><br />

            Most of us make content because we enjoy the creative outlet, enjoy the content we create, like watching
            players engage with our creations, or any other reason or combination of them. To put it simply: it's fun,
            and that's a reward in itself. <br /><br />
            If you still insist on supporting a creator directly, then please consider reaching out to Rizato, SirPam,
            or Asmodean instead. It truly is the thought that counts and I really do appreciate that you even took the
            time to look at my ghrugs. That is enough, truly.<br /><br />
            Look, if you're still reading this and insistent that <em>I</em> have given <em>you</em> something of value
            and you wish to help pick up some of the costs I incur with my ongoing development, then click the button
            below, but only give if you can more than afford to do so and if you can do so selflessly. There are no
            rewards or quid pro quo or perks or favoritism or anything like that that you will get for doing so.
